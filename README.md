# SecurityJourneyWorkSample
Work Sample Submission for Security Journey.

In this work sample we discuss OS Command Injection, and high level discussion of Securing Kubernetes Secrets and proactively monitoring the application with Prometheus.


## Install and Run the flask app

This is a companion application that helps with a deeper understanding of Command Injection vulnerability in web applications. 
```bash
pip3 install flask # or pip install flask

python3 main.py # or python main.py
```
The CommandInjection.md file has the main work sample. 

I have submitted a writeup of the vulnerability analysis and penetration testing I conducted at NYU(coursework).
